Custom splash screens for Mi 9T (davinci)

Download in GitHub releases

How to flash: fastboot flash logo logo-*.img

logo-mi.img - Current Mi splash screen

logo-mi-old.img - Mi splash screen before MIUI 13

logo-redmi.img - Redmi splash screen

logo-mi-color.img - Current Mi logo in full color

logo-google.img - A copy of the Pixel splash screen, looks great with PixelExperience

logo-google-lock.img - The same as logo-google.img but with a pixel-style bootloader unlocked icon added

logo-google-white.img - A monochrome, nexus-like version of the Pixel splash screen

All splash screens come without the bootloader unlocked icon unless specified otherwise and with a custom fastboot screen
All of them were tested but I cannot guarantee they will work on your device
# I DO NOT PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT
Only for Xiaomi Mi 9T/Redmi K20 [davinci]
To return to the default splash screen, download the latest recovery flashable stock rom, extract it, go to the extracted folder then to the firmware-update folder and flash logo.img using the same command you used to flash the custom splash screen.
